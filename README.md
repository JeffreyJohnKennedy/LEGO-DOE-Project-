LEGO DOE Project 🚗📊

Team 102 – SCM 517, W. P. Carey School of Business (MSBA Program)

📌 Overview

This project applies Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology to optimize the performance of a LEGO race car. Using a factorial experimental design, we tested how factors such as wheel base, axle base, wheel size, and weight distribution influence the distance traveled down a 30° ramp.

By blending creativity with statistical rigor, this project highlights how DOE principles can be applied to real-world engineering and business analytics problems.

🎯 Objective

Primary Goal: Design and optimize a LEGO race car capable of traveling the maximum distance down a ramp.

Constraints:

Only LEGO blocks provided in the kit were used.

Each design required a windshield and steering wheel.

Cost considerations were incorporated using the Bill of Materials.

🧩 Experimental Setup

Ramp Specifications: Height = 15 cm, Length = 30 cm, Angle = 30°

Factors and Levels:

Factor	Levels Tested
Wheel Base	3.5 cm, 5.0 cm
Axle Base	1.5 cm, 3.4 cm
Wheel Size	Small, Large
Weight Distribution	Front, Back

Response Variable: Distance traveled (cm)

Replication: Each of the 16 design combinations was tested 3 times (full factorial design = 48 trials).

🔬 Methodology

DOE Approach: Full Factorial Design (2⁴ = 16 combinations).

Software Used: Minitab for statistical analysis and visualization.

Analysis Performed:

Main effects analysis

Two-way and three-way interactions

Model diagnostics (R², Adjusted R², Predicted R²)

Outlier detection
